# Cursor Rules – Root

This project uses structured rules under `.cursor/rules`.  
Always load all rule files and apply them to every task, especially UI-related tasks.

The assistant must:

- Enforce consistent UX across the project.
- Prevent layout shift.
- Ensure smooth scrolling and correct loading states.
- Provide clear, pleasant user feedback.
- Respect accessibility (WCAG AA level).
- Follow the project’s design tokens and component structure.

When modifying any UI/React/Tailwind/Next.js code:
- Apply all UX rules automatically, even if the user did not request them explicitly.
- Prefer improving UX quality silently when detecting issues.
