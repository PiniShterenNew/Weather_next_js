## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Option 1: Read & Decide (30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Get the overview
open ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md          # 10 min

# 2. See visual comparison
open ARCHITECTURE_VISUAL_COMPARISON.md  # 5 min

# 3. Review migration guide
open MIGRATION_GUIDE.md               # 15 min

# 4. Make decision on approach
```

### Option 2: Execute Migration (4-6 hours)
```bash
# 1. Create backup
git checkout -b backup-before-migration
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature/complete-architecture-migration

# 2. Follow migration guide Phase 1 (HIGH PRIORITY)
# - Delete duplicate store
# - Consolidate search components
# - Consolidate settings components
# - Update all imports
# Time: 2-3 hours

# 3. Follow migration guide Phase 2-4 (MEDIUM/LOW PRIORITY)
# - Reorganize tests
# - Split large files

# Time: 2-3 hours

# 4. Test and merge
npm run test && npm run build
git merge feature/complete-architecture-migration
```

### Option 3: Quick Wins Only (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Execute Phase 1 only (consolidate duplicates)
# Skip test reorganization and file splitting
# Minimum viable improvement
```

## 🎯 Architecture Patterns You're Using

### ✅ Current Good Practices
- **Next.js 15 App Router** with proper i18n routing (`[locale]`)
- **Zustand** for global state management with persistence
- **Feature-based architecture** (partially implemented)
- **shadcn/ui** component library
- **Tailwind CSS** with design tokens
- **TypeScript** with comprehensive types
- **next-intl** for internationalization with RTL support
- **Vitest + Playwright** for testing
- **API routes** with caching layer

### ⚠️ Patterns to Improve
- **Complete feature-based migration** (currently partial)
- **Consistent barrel exports** (some missing)
- **Centralized test location** (currently scattered)
- **File size limits** (enforce 200-line limit)
